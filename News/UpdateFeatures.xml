    <content>To simplify my mod-updating and improve this mod I have chosen to remove the cannibal vanilla-meals in this mod. This mod was primarly intended as a patch for VGP and since I already have a mod that adds cannibal versions of vanilla meals that also has support for other mods structures and races I think its better if these two mods can be used side by side instead.

If you have vanilla-type cannibal meals in your save that you would like to keep, please subscribe to my other mod and reload your save as it uses the same meal-definitions as this mod used.
The other mod is linked from this mods steam-page that is linked in this post.

I hope this will not cause any irritation or issues for you, please report if it causes errors!
