 For helping with translations, please see the github-link above.

If dismarzero (VPG owner) wants to publish this as a separate VGP I'll gladly take this down and send over the files.
This is originally an expansion of Tremeloe's Cook Cannibal Meal (IndividualStack) 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1297883744 that has not been updated to 1.0 yet. This mod also adds Tremeloe's meals to the VGP Food Prep-table.

[h1]Update[/h1]
To simplify my mod-updating and improve this mod I have chosen to remove the cannibal vanilla-meals in this mod. This mod was primarly intended as a patch for VGP and since I already have a mod that adds cannibal versions of vanilla meals that also has support for other mods structures and races I think its better if these two mods can be used side by side instead.
If you have vanilla-type cannibal meals in your save that you would like to keep, please subscribe to my other mod and reload your save as it uses the same meal-definitions as this mod used.
